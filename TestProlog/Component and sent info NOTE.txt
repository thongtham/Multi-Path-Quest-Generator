ใช้ระบบ token 

เช่นจาก goto(Griffin loc), [เลข 2] 
ลงมาเป็น prepare [เลข 3]
ลงมาเป็น goto(NOT_SELECT_YET)   >>>>>> token = [Griffin]

ตัว goto() ขึ้นไปเจอ goto(Griffin Loc) that is repeating of itself. Thus it cannot not put (Griffin Loc) into itself. 
Thus it random (Hunter) to put into goto

now at learn(NOT_SELECT_YET) [เลข 5] >>>> The token = [Griffin, Hunter]

this learn(OBJ), the OBJ must be item of type 'information'. 
From token that is past down, it can choose from ['Griffin's location Info, Hunter's location info,], it choose Griffin ?????



*************IDEA that should work ************

Token system, however, each sub-token has priority. 

EX.  Griffin = 3 sub-token = [Info, Location, Griffin itself]

RULE 1: Here, when griffen is selected, it will select Info 1st, then if Info already selected, Location will be selected, then Griffin itself. (see blueo square)

RULE 2: the token will be selected by the latest one that is 'created'. See (orange and green square) on this.

RULE 3: Token is unlock after the corespound Component is pass. EX. at [15]
Otherwise, the earliest unlocked token is used.

EXTRA RULE
*No need to follow [Info > Location, itself]  (see green square)

*Here the token [Dogs info] isn't used yet, but Goto(XXX) cannot use Info token, thus the next token is select instead (loc in this case).

*Another example is at [26]
>>Here Follow() can only use Character, thus 'Hunter itself' which is a character is selected.

------

*EXECEPTION at [6] && [34]
>>>Here goto() should use Hunter's Loc, but instead, it use Hunter's House

[OPTION 2 so this make sense]
***If goto() happen and the current token isn't at the [loc] or [itself], select a random location that is related to the token.

//[OPTION 1 so this make sense]
//***This is because the next Component is Explore()
//***When goto() is follow by explore(), goto() must be Location As in Location (not the character's current location)

*EXCEPTION at [49]
>>>Here the previous Component is [ goto(Griffin loc) ]
The most logical token for [use()] is [use(Griffin) ]
BUT INSTEAD, (BUCKHORN) IS SELECTED

[OPTION 1]
***Use can only use 'item' token. & because the only token left is Griffin ITSELF, >>> [select the last item token that exist]

TOKEN
**If no token is legit or avaiable, 'create/choose' a token from game world.
**Some ComponentRule will force create new token?
